Power BI Bookmarks are one of the most powerful tools for creating interactive, user-driven experiences within dashboards. They allow you to capture the current state of a report page‚Äîincluding filters, slicers, visuals, and drill-throughs‚Äîand return to it with a single click. Bookmarks work best when combined with a strong visual foundation ‚Äî [custom themes](/posts/power-bi-custom-theme/) for colors and fonts, and [backgrounds/icons](/posts/power-bi-backgrounds-icons/) for layout and navigation cues.

## üõ† How to Use Power BI Bookmarks in Dashboards

In my dashboards, I use bookmarks to:

- Create ‚ÄúQuick View‚Äù toggles between summary and detail
- Build guided walkthroughs for onboarding new users
- Reset slicers to default states for clarity
- Highlight strategic KPIs during leadership reviews

Bookmarks paired with buttons and selection panes create a seamless experience that feels more like an app than a static report.

For example, a branded [report template](/posts/power-bi-report-templates/) ensures consistency, while bookmarks add the interactivity on top.
