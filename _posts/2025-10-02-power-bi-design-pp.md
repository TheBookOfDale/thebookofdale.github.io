Once you‚Äôve established a **report template** and a **custom theme**, the next step in building a professional reporting ecosystem is to create **template objects** ‚Äî reusable backgrounds and icons. These elements give your reports polish, consistency, and a sense of identity that aligns with your organization‚Äôs brand and builds on your [report templates](/posts/power-bi-report-templates/) and [custom theme](/posts/power-bi-custom-theme/) to complete a cohesive design system.

## üé® Why Use PowerPoint to Design Power BI Backgrounds and Icons

PowerPoint is an underrated design tool for Power BI. It offers:
- **Precision control** over shapes, alignment, and layering.  
- **Easy export** to high‚Äëresolution PNGs or SVGs.  
- **Brand alignment** by using your corporate color palette and fonts.  
- **Icon creation** without needing Illustrator or Photoshop.  

---

## üñºÔ∏è Step 1 ‚Äî Create a Power BI Report Background in PowerPoint

1. Open PowerPoint and set the **slide size** to match Power BI‚Äôs canvas (16:9).  
2. Add **header and footer zones** for titles, filters, or logos.  
3. Use **brand colors** (from your theme JSON) for accents and section dividers.  
4. Keep it **minimal** ‚Äî backgrounds should guide, not distract.  
5. Export the slide as a **PNG** and set it as the page background in Power BI.

### Contoso Manufacturing Example (Background)

       alt="Screenshot of Contoso background applied in Power BI Desktop"
       class="img-fluid">
  <figcaption class="text-center small text-muted">
    Figure 1 ‚Äî Contoso background applied in Power BI Desktop
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For this example, we‚Äôll design a sidebar to hold navigation buttons. Since each button is **48‚ÄØpx** tall, we‚Äôll create a sidebar that‚Äôs **60‚ÄØpx wide** ‚Äî large enough for usability without stealing too much canvas space. In PowerPoint:

- **Draw a rectangle** 0.55 inches wide.  
- **Add a second rectangle** 0.13 inches wide alongside it.  
- **Fill each shape** with contrasting colors from your theme to create a two‚Äëtone sidebar.  
- **Export the slide** as a PNG. In Power BI, open the **Format pane ‚Üí Canvas background**, upload your PNG, and set **transparency = 0**.

---

## üî≤ Step 2 ‚Äî Design Custom Power BI Icons in PowerPoint

Icons are powerful for navigation and storytelling. In PowerPoint:
- Use **basic shapes** (circles, rectangles, triangles) and combine them.  
- Apply **brand colors** for consistency.  
- Export as **transparent PNGs** or **SVGs** for crisp scaling.  
- Examples: navigation arrows, KPI indicators, section dividers, or status symbols.

### Contoso Manufacturing Example (Icons)

<figure class="float-end ms-3 mb-3" style="max-width:300px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/power-bi-design-pp/custom-pages-icon.png"
       alt="Screenshot of custom icon for page navigation in Power BI"
       class="img-fluid">
  <figcaption class="text-center small text-muted">
    Figure 2 ‚Äî Custom icon for page navigation in Power BI
  </figcaption>
</figure>

For this example, we‚Äôll design navigation icons that fit neatly into the **60‚ÄØpx sidebar**. Since our target size in Power BI is **48√ó48‚ÄØpx**, we‚Äôll design larger in PowerPoint for crisp scaling:

- **Set up a square canvas** about **1.5 in √ó 1.5 in** (‚âà144√ó144‚ÄØpx) to design each icon.  
- **Draw simple shapes** (arrows, circles, or status symbols) and combine them into meaningful icons.  
- **Apply brand colors**: use light gray `#E0E0E0` or white for default icons, and accent colors like orange `#E87722` or green `#4CAF50` for active or status states.  
- **Export each icon** as a **PNG with transparent background**.  
- In Power BI, **insert the PNG** and resize it to **48√ó48‚ÄØpx** so it aligns perfectly within the sidebar.  

---

## ‚ö° Step 3 ‚Äî Apply Backgrounds and Icons in Power BI

- Import your background into the **Page Background** property.  
- Use icons as **buttons** for bookmarks, navigation, or tooltips.  
- Combine with your **custom theme** so visuals, colors, and layout all align. 

Pairing icons with [Power BI Bookmarks](/posts/power-bi-bookmarks/) allows you to create interactive navigation that feels app‚Äëlike.

### Contoso Manufacturing Example (Applying Sidebar + Icons)

<figure class="float-end ms-3 mb-3" style="max-width:200px;">
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/power-bi-design-pp/contoso-sidebar.png"
       alt="Screenshot of custom sidebar for standard template in Power BI"
       class="img-fluid">
  <figcaption class="text-center small text-muted">
    Figure 3 ‚Äî Custom sidebar for standard template in Power BI
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Now that we have both the **sidebar background** and **navigation icons**, we can bring them together in Power BI:

- **Set the background:** In the **Format pane ‚Üí Canvas background**, upload the sidebar PNG and set transparency to **0**.  
- **Insert icons:** Add your exported PNG icons and resize them to **48√ó48‚ÄØpx** so they align neatly within the 60‚ÄØpx sidebar.  
- **Position consistently:** Place icons in a vertical column, leaving equal spacing between each for a clean, balanced look.  
- **Assign actions:** Turn each icon into a **button** and link it to a **bookmark** or **page navigation** action.  
- **Test interactivity:** Switch between bookmarks to confirm the sidebar feels like an app‚Äëstyle navigation menu.  

This combination of a branded sidebar and consistent icons creates a polished, professional navigation system that feels intuitive and reinforces Contoso Manufacturing‚Äôs identity.
