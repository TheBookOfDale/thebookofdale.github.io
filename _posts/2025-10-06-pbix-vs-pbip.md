## üß≠ PBIX vs PBIP: What‚Äôs the Difference?

Power BI now supports two primary file formats for authoring and managing reports:

| Feature         | PBIX (Classic)            | PBIP (Project Format)                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Format          | Binary file               | Folder-based project with text-based files      |
| Version Control | Difficult (binary format) | Git-friendly (ideal for source control)         |
| Collaboration   | Limited (single file)     | Modular (supports team-based development)       |
| Editing Tools   | Power BI Desktop only     | Power BI Desktop + text editors (e.g., VS Code) |
| Deployment      | Manual or via pipelines   | Better suited for CI/CD and automation          |
| Availability    | Default format            | Preview (as of 2025)                            |

## üß± What Is PBIX?

PBIX is the original Power BI file format ‚Äî a single binary file that contains your report visuals, data model, queries, and metadata. It‚Äôs portable and easy to share, but not ideal for version control or team collaboration.

**Best for:**
- Individual report development
- Quick prototyping
- Sharing via email or Teams

---

## üß™ What Is PBIP?

PBIP (Power BI Project) is a new folder-based format introduced with Power BI Desktop Developer Mode. It separates your report and semantic model into human-readable text files (JSON, DAX, TMDL), making it easier to track changes, collaborate in Git, and automate deployments.

**Best for:**
- Enterprise BI teams using GitHub or Azure DevOps
- CI/CD pipelines and automated testing
- Modular development and semantic model reuse

---

## üß† Strategic Considerations

- **PBIX is still the default** and widely supported, especially for business users and analysts.
- **PBIP is ideal for developers** and teams adopting software engineering practices like source control, branching, and DevOps.
- You can **convert PBIX to PBIP** by enabling Developer Mode in Power BI Desktop and saving as a project.
- PBIP is currently in **preview**, so not all features (e.g., paginated reports, certain visuals) are fully supported.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I convert a PBIX file to PBIP?
Yes ‚Äî open the PBIX in Power BI Desktop with Developer Mode enabled, then choose ‚ÄúSave as Project‚Äù to export it as a PBIP folder.

### Is PBIP production-ready?
PBIP is still in preview (as of October 2025). It‚Äôs stable for many use cases, but some features (like paginated reports or certain visuals) may not be fully supported yet.

### Can I use Git with PBIX files?
Technically yes, but it‚Äôs not ideal. PBIX is a binary format, so Git can‚Äôt track changes meaningfully. PBIP is designed for Git-based workflows.

### Should I switch to PBIP now?
If you‚Äôre working in a team, using source control, or building CI/CD pipelines, PBIP is worth exploring. For solo development or quick builds, PBIX remains a solid choice.
