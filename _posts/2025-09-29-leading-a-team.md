## 📊 You’re Leading an Analytics Team—Now What?

So, you’ve been tasked with leading an analytics team. Congratulations! Whether you’ve been promoted internally or brought in from another role, the first instinct might be to dive headfirst into dashboards, reports, and data models. After all, that’s probably what you’ve been doing up until now.

But here’s the catch: if you start there, you may be skipping the most critical step—building a scalable, collaborative foundation for analytics to thrive.

---

## 🧱 Start with Structure, Not Just Data

Before you get lost in the numbers, take a step back and architect the environment your team will operate in. A strong data foundation isn’t just about clean tables and good visuals—it’s about governance, collaboration, and repeatability.

---

## 🛠️ Leverage the Microsoft Stack

If your organization is already embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem, you’ve got powerful tools at your fingertips. Use them to build a centralized, cloud-based hub for your team.

### 🔗 Create a Microsoft Team and SharePoint Site

**Why it matters**: Creating a Microsoft Team automatically provisions a SharePoint site, giving you a collaborative workspace with built-in version control and cloud storage.

**What to include**:
- A document library for policies, procedures, and templates
- SharePoint lists for tracking requests, feedback, and intake forms
- PowerApps integration to turn those lists into dynamic, user-friendly forms

---

### 📁 Document Your Operating Model

Set expectations early by documenting how your team will manage analytics assets and workflows. Consider including:

- Power BI Workspace administration guidelines  
- Report lifecycle management (from request to retirement)  
- Analytics lifecycle management (from exploration to production)  
- Governance policies for naming conventions, access control, and versioning  

---

### 📊 Build a Report Repository

Create a centralized space for published reports and dashboards. Use a standard template to ensure consistency in branding, layout, and metadata. This not only improves user experience but also reinforces trust in your team’s outputs.

---

### ⚙️ Automate Where You Can

Integrate PowerApps with SharePoint lists to streamline intake, feedback, and support processes. Whether it’s a request form for new reports or a feedback loop for existing dashboards, automation reduces friction and improves responsiveness.

---

## 💡 Final Thought

Leading an analytics team isn’t just about producing insights—it’s about enabling a system where insights can be requested, created, shared, and evolved. Start with structure. Build with intention. And let the data follow.
