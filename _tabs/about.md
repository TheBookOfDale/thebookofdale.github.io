## Who I Am

I'm Christopher Dale—a strategic leader in analytics and operational systems. I empower teams through data, systems, and clarity, blending technical rigor with a human-centered approach.

## What I Do

As Manager of Data Analytics & Operational Systems at SRCTec, I lead a team responsible for advanced analytics, MES/ERP/timekeeping system administration, user enablement, and integration management.

## Core Capabilities

- Power BI, SQL, and process automation  
- MES/ERP/timekeeping platform stewardship  
- System integration and reconciliation  
- Technical web development (Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Markdown)  
- User enablement and cross-functional training  

## How I Lead

I believe in clarity, empowerment, and continuous improvement. I build data-literate teams, architect scalable systems, and foster a culture of strategic enablement.
